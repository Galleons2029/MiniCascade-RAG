The data given includes:
- In a season where Nash had a **62–20 record** and a **points-per-game average of 110.4**, he made **43.1% of his three-pointers** (which is below the 40% threshold for the 50-40-90 club).
- In the **1999–2000 season**, he averaged **4.9 assists per game**, but this refers to assists, not 3-point attempts.

The 50-40-90 club is typically associated with Nash's **2005–06 season**, where he achieved 50.3% field goal, 40.2% 3-point, and 90.3% free throw accuracy. However, the provided text does not include his **3-point attempt statistics** for that specific season. 

**Conclusion:** The available information does not specify Nash's average 3-point attempts per game during his 50-40-90 seasons. To answer accurately, additional data on his 3-point attempt averages for those years would be required.",4 3-points attempts per game,0.8181818181818182,0.0,0.0,0.0
what is a movie to feature a person who can create and control a device that can manipulate the laws of physics?,"[' life is easily explainable (or analyzable) using the elementary physics that one learns in late high school and perhaps early university courses. Using this most basic physics, the author has done an absolutely superb job of dissecting the scientific credibility of modern movies using the scalpel of Newtonian physics and the laws of thermodynamics.

However, it discusses how movies often incorporate physics concepts (e.g., Newtonian physics, thermodynamics) and may take creative liberties for storytelling. 

If you're looking for such a movie, examples might include:
- **""Inception"" (2010)**: Explores dream-sharing technology that bends physical laws (e.g., gravity, time).
- **""The Prestige"" (2006)**: Features devices and illusions that manipulate physics for magical effects.
- **""Doctor Strange"" (2016)**: Involves the manipulation of reality and physics through mystical means.
- **""Back to the Future"" (1985)**: Uses a DeLorean time machine, which theoretically defies physics.

These examples are based on general knowledge of films with physics-defying technology, as the provided text does not specify a particular movie.
